## [2026-06-29] Feature: TI-84 Calculator Website with Theme Toggle and Docker

**Objective:**
Provide a simple, professional single-page site that embeds the online TI-84 calculator with a light/dark theme toggle, served from a Docker container.

**Approach:**
- Static `index.html` using Tailwind CSS via CDN with class-based dark mode and a `localStorage`-backed theme toggle.
- Embed the provided iframe (`https://ti84calc.com/ti84calc`) inside a responsive container.
- Package with an Nginx Alpine Docker image for one-command deployment.

**Tests:**
No automated tests (static site). Manual verification: theme toggle persists across reloads, iframe renders, Docker build and run succeed.

**Risks & Tradeoffs:**
- Tailwind via CDN is simplest but not recommended for production performance; acceptable for this lightweight page.
- Availability of the embedded iframe depends on the third-party site.
