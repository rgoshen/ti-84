## [2026-06-29 17:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Website + Docker

**Summary:**
Added a single-page website (`index.html`) embedding the TI-84 online calculator in an iframe with a light/dark theme toggle (Tailwind CSS via CDN, persisted to localStorage). Packaged with an Nginx Alpine Dockerfile for one-command hosting. Added README, .gitignore, and TODO documentation.

**Rationale:**
Static site with CDN Tailwind keeps the project simple and dependency-free while still offering a polished, theme-aware UI. Nginx Alpine image is tiny and reliable for serving static content.
