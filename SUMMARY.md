## [2026-06-29 17:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Website + Docker

**Summary:**
Added a single-page website (`index.html`) embedding the TI-84 online calculator in an iframe with a light/dark theme toggle (Tailwind CSS via CDN, persisted to localStorage). Packaged with an Nginx Alpine Dockerfile for one-command hosting. Added README, .gitignore, and TODO documentation.

**Rationale:**
Static site with CDN Tailwind keeps the project simple and dependency-free while still offering a polished, theme-aware UI. Nginx Alpine image is tiny and reliable for serving static content.

## [2026-06-29 17:10] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** README + CONTRIBUTING

**Summary:**
Enhanced README.md with status badges, screenshot placeholders (light/dark), a Contributing section, and an updated project structure. Added CONTRIBUTING.md describing the GitHub Flow workflow, commit conventions, code style, testing expectations, PR checklist, and issue reporting. Added a docs/ folder with a README explaining screenshot capture.

**Rationale:**
A professional README with badges and screenshots makes the project more discoverable and trustworthy. A dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md lowers the barrier for contributors and enforces consistent workflows and commit messages.

## [2026-06-29 17:20] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** Docker instructions

**Summary:**
Updated all `docker run` commands across README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and docs/README.md to use `--name graphing-calculator` so the container has a predictable name instead of Docker's random generated name. Added stop/remove instructions to the README.

**Rationale:**
A named container is easier to stop, remove, and reference in scripts/logs than a random container name. Keeps the developer experience consistent and predictable.

- CONTRIBUTING.md: Getting Started

## [2026-06-29 17:30] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** Docker instructions

**Summary:**
Added the `-d` (detached/headless) flag to all `docker run` commands in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and docs/README.md so the container runs in the background. Added a note explaining detached mode and a `docker logs` command for viewing container output.

**Rationale:**
Detached mode is the standard way to run a long-lived web server container without blocking the terminal. Surfacing the logs command makes the headless workflow complete.

## [2026-06-29 17:40] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** TODO.md planning

**Summary:**
Added a planned-feature entry to TODO.md for a custom equation graphing calculator (type an equation, render it, stack multiple equations on the same graph until cleared). Documented the recommended approach (static site + Tailwind + lightweight plotting lib such as Function Plot, no MUI/React migration) along with risks and tradeoffs.

**Rationale:**
Capturing the roadmap decision now preserves the stack rationale (avoid MUI + Tailwind dual-styling clash; defer React migration) and gives a concrete plan to execute against when implementation begins.

## [2026-06-29 17:50] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** TODO.md roadmap

**Summary:**
Added a planned-feature entry to TODO.md for an AI step-by-step math solver: user submits a math problem, an LLM returns structured JSON steps (expression + explanation), and the frontend renders an ordered steps panel. Documented approach (static frontend + separate API layer for key security, MathJax/LaTeX rendering, reuse theme toggle), tests (manual + backend unit tests + eval set), risks (backend dependency, cost/latency, hallucinations, key security, model choice), and dependencies (API layer decision; coordinate styling with the graphing calculator feature).

**Rationale:**
Logging the AI solver alongside the graphing calculator captures the full roadmap and the shared infrastructure decisions (avoid React/MUI, introduce a minimal API layer, keep static frontend). Preserves rationale for when implementation begins.

## [2026-06-29 18:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Website — navigation + Graphing Calculator Online page

**Summary:**
Added a shared navigation menu to index.html with two options (TI-84, Graphing Calculator Online). Created graphing.html containing the provided marketing content for the Graphing Calculator Online, structured into themed sections (intro, why use, key features, how to use) with cards, lists, and ordered steps. Both pages share the light/dark theme toggle and persist theme choice via localStorage. Updated the Dockerfile to copy all *.html files so Nginx serves both pages. Updated README, docs/README, and TODO/SUMMARY accordingly.

**Rationale:**
A shared nav turns the single-page site into a small themed multi-page experience with consistent styling and theme behavior. Copying all HTML files via a glob keeps the Dockerfile simple while supporting multiple pages. The Graphing Calculator Online page is content-only for now; the interactive equation plotting feature remains planned in TODO.md.

## [2026-06-29 18:30] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** Graphing Calculator Online page

**Summary:**
Replaced the text-only graphing.html with a fully functional online graphing calculator. Uses Function Plot (D3-based, ~30KB, via CDN) to plot equations entered by the user. Supports stacking multiple equations on the same axes (each gets a distinct color and a removable chip in the list), a Clear all control, manual window/domain controls, and native zoom/pan (scroll + drag). The plot re-themes (background, grid, axes, text) when the light/dark toggle changes. The descriptive marketing content from the prior version is preserved inside a collapsible "About" details section below the calculator.

**Rationale:**
The previous version misinterpreted the requirement as a content page. This commit delivers the actual interactive graphing calculator that was requested, while keeping the static-site + CDN approach (no React/build step). Function Plot was chosen for its small size and native support for multiple functions, zoom, and pan.

## [2026-06-29 19:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Graphing Calculator Online — usability improvements

**Summary:**
Four improvements to the interactive graphing calculator:
1. Dark mode line visibility — explicitly set each function line's stroke color and width (2.5px) after Function Plot renders, so curves stay visible against the dark background.
2. Per-equation color picker — the color swatch in the plotted-equations list is now a label wrapping a hidden native `<input type="color">`; clicking it opens the OS color picker and re-themes that equation's line, swatch, and table header live.
3. Value table — added a table below the graph showing y values evaluated at every whole-number x in the current window (one column per plotted equation, color-coded to match the graph). Uses math.js (CDN) for safe expression evaluation (no eval).
4. Show points with shape — each equation has a "Show points" checkbox and a shape selector (circle / square / triangle). When enabled, points are drawn on the graph at each integer x using the equation's color and chosen shape via a custom SVG overlay.

**Rationale:**
Dark mode lines were invisible because Function Plot's default styling faded against the dark SVG background; forcing stroke color per equation fixes it deterministically. Native color input gives a familiar, accessible picker with zero dependencies. The table and points features were explicitly requested and use math.js to evaluate expressions safely and consistently with the graph.

## [2026-06-29 19:30] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Docker / configuration

**Summary:**
Added docker-compose.yml with sensible default environment variables (HOST_PORT, SITE_TITLE_TI84, SITE_TITLE_GRAPHING, THEME_DEFAULT, TI84_IFRAME_SRC). Added .env.example documenting all variables. Refactored the Docker image to use a docker-entrypoint.sh that runs envsubst over the HTML templates at container start, so env vars actually flow into the served pages (titles, default theme, iframe source). Updated index.html and graphing.html to use ${VAR} placeholders for those values. Updated README with a Compose quick-start, a variables table, a .env example, and the plain docker run equivalent. .gitignore now excludes .env and .env.local while .env.example stays tracked.

**Rationale:**
Docker Compose gives a one-command, reproducible local run with named-container and port defaults baked in. Routing env vars through envsubst (vs. a static COPY) means the same image can be reused across environments (dev/staging/prod) with different titles, default themes, or iframe sources without rebuilding. Keeping .env out of version control protects any real overrides while .env.example documents the contract.
