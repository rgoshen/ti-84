## [2026-06-29 17:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Website + Docker

**Summary:**
Added a single-page website (`index.html`) embedding the TI-84 online calculator in an iframe with a light/dark theme toggle (Tailwind CSS via CDN, persisted to localStorage). Packaged with an Nginx Alpine Dockerfile for one-command hosting. Added README, .gitignore, and TODO documentation.

**Rationale:**
Static site with CDN Tailwind keeps the project simple and dependency-free while still offering a polished, theme-aware UI. Nginx Alpine image is tiny and reliable for serving static content.

## [2026-06-29 17:10] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** README + CONTRIBUTING

**Summary:**
Enhanced README.md with status badges, screenshot placeholders (light/dark), a Contributing section, and an updated project structure. Added CONTRIBUTING.md describing the GitHub Flow workflow, commit conventions, code style, testing expectations, PR checklist, and issue reporting. Added a docs/ folder with a README explaining screenshot capture.

**Rationale:**
A professional README with badges and screenshots makes the project more discoverable and trustworthy. A dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md lowers the barrier for contributors and enforces consistent workflows and commit messages.

## [2026-06-29 17:20] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** Docker instructions

**Summary:**
Updated all `docker run` commands across README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and docs/README.md to use `--name graphing-calculator` so the container has a predictable name instead of Docker's random generated name. Added stop/remove instructions to the README.

**Rationale:**
A named container is easier to stop, remove, and reference in scripts/logs than a random container name. Keeps the developer experience consistent and predictable.

- README.md: Running locally with Docker
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Getting Started

## [2026-06-29 17:30] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** Docker instructions

**Summary:**
Added the `-d` (detached/headless) flag to all `docker run` commands in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and docs/README.md so the container runs in the background. Added a note explaining detached mode and a `docker logs` command for viewing container output.

**Rationale:**
Detached mode is the standard way to run a long-lived web server container without blocking the terminal. Surfacing the logs command makes the headless workflow complete.

## [2026-06-29 17:40] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** TODO.md planning

**Summary:**
Added a planned-feature entry to TODO.md for a custom equation graphing calculator (type an equation, render it, stack multiple equations on the same graph until cleared). Documented the recommended approach (static site + Tailwind + lightweight plotting lib such as Function Plot, no MUI/React migration) along with risks and tradeoffs.

**Rationale:**
Capturing the roadmap decision now preserves the stack rationale (avoid MUI + Tailwind dual-styling clash; defer React migration) and gives a concrete plan to execute against when implementation begins.

## [2026-06-29 17:50] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** TODO.md roadmap

**Summary:**
Added a planned-feature entry to TODO.md for an AI step-by-step math solver: user submits a math problem, an LLM returns structured JSON steps (expression + explanation), and the frontend renders an ordered steps panel. Documented approach (static frontend + separate API layer for key security, MathJax/LaTeX rendering, reuse theme toggle), tests (manual + backend unit tests + eval set), risks (backend dependency, cost/latency, hallucinations, key security, model choice), and dependencies (API layer decision; coordinate styling with the graphing calculator feature).

**Rationale:**
Logging the AI solver alongside the graphing calculator captures the full roadmap and the shared infrastructure decisions (avoid React/MUI, introduce a minimal API layer, keep static frontend). Preserves rationale for when implementation begins.

## [2026-06-29 18:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** Website — navigation + Graphing Calculator Online page

**Summary:**
Added a shared navigation menu to index.html with two options (TI-84, Graphing Calculator Online). Created graphing.html containing the provided marketing content for the Graphing Calculator Online, structured into themed sections (intro, why use, key features, how to use) with cards, lists, and ordered steps. Both pages share the light/dark theme toggle and persist theme choice via localStorage. Updated the Dockerfile to copy all *.html files so Nginx serves both pages. Updated README, docs/README, and TODO/SUMMARY accordingly.

**Rationale:**
A shared nav turns the single-page site into a small themed multi-page experience with consistent styling and theme behavior. Copying all HTML files via a glob keeps the Dockerfile simple while supporting multiple pages. The Graphing Calculator Online page is content-only for now; the interactive equation plotting feature remains planned in TODO.md.
